This project involves building a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset contains various features derived from cell measurements of breast mass samples, and the goal is to predict whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

The models tested include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN, and Logistic Regression with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

The project successfully classifies breast cancer tumors with high accuracy. The best model based on our evaluation metrics is Logistic Regression with PCA.
